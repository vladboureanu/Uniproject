## Key Features:

- ### Interactive Travel Map: 
  
  The application will display an interactive map where users can visually document their travel experiences. Users will be able to zoom in and out, pan the map, and explore different regions.

- ### Location Tagging: 
  
  Users will have the ability to tag specific locations they have visited on the map by placing markers. These markers will represent their travel destinations and will include custom icons or images associated with each location.

- ### Journal Entries: 
  
  For each tagged location, users can create journal entries to capture their experiences, memories, and feelings about the place. They can write detailed descriptions, add photos, and include other media such as videos or audio recordings.

- ### User Profiles: 
  
  The application will include user profiles where individuals can showcase their travel history, the number of countries visited, and their favorite destinations. 

- ### Search and Filtering: 
  
  The application will provide search functionality to allow users to search for specific locations, countries, or keywords within journal entries. Additionally, users can filter their map view based on different criteria such as date range, favorite destinations, or visited places.
